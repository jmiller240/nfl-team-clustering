-------

t-SNE is very useful visualization tool
    - Determine shape of data (linear, non-linear, etc.) in exploratory phase
    - Visualize high-D results of learning model (e.g., visualize cluster results of high-D dataset)

PCA is useful as visualization tool AND feature selection tool AND even on its own
    - Perhaps not as useful as t-SNE for visualization, as t-SNE maintains local proximities / relationships
    - But since it maintains variance and global distances, it can reliably and usefully be used to reduce (and essentially select) features for further modeling
    - And, you could even try to assign meaning to the new features

Correlations
------------

Strong correlation between neutral down and normal
    - Under center vs shotgun usage rates
    - Pass rates

    - Ignoring neutral downs


Under center rate and shotgun pass rate are strong positive correlation
    - Shotgun rate and shotgun pass rate are strong ~negative~ correlation

    - Makes sense; the more you use shotgun, the more you probably run from it
    - Whereas, the more you use under center, the more you probably run from it, meaning the more you pass when using shotgun


Distributions
-------------

Most features look fairly normal...

Remove personnel %s except 11 and maybe heavy, as the rest are so small/sparse and not normally distributed


Variance
--------

Plays / Game (i.e., pace) has most variance

Before scaling, variance is just the features with the largest scales


Visualization
--------

PCA:
Appears "non-flat" looking at 3D graph of top 3 PCA components
    - Top 3 components explains 39% variance

Appears spherical to me

t-SNE:
Very much spherical!

Most features are fairly normal before scaling, so standarization and normalization produce similar distributions
    --> Probably the method based on the modeling procedure (aka, standardization usually best for PCA)

Interested in HDBSCAN and OPTICS for the variable density aspects
