Lessons
-------

t-SNE is very useful visualization tool
    - Determine shape of data (linear, non-linear, etc.) in exploratory phase
    - Visualize high-D results of learning model (e.g., visualize cluster results of high-D dataset)

PCA is useful as visualization tool AND feature selection tool AND even on its own
    - Perhaps not as useful as t-SNE for visualization, as t-SNE maintains local proximities / relationships
    - But since it maintains variance and global distances, it can reliably and usefully be used to reduce (and essentially select) features for further modeling
    - And, you could even try to assign meaning to the new features



Correlations
------------

Strong correlation between neutral down and normal
    - Under center vs shotgun usage rates
    - Pass rates

    - Ignoring neutral downs


Under center rate and shotgun pass rate are strong positive correlation
    - Shotgun rate and shotgun pass rate are strong ~negative~ correlation

    - Makes sense; the more you use shotgun, the more you probably run from it
    - Whereas, the more you use under center, the more you probably run from it, meaning the more you pass when using shotgun


Variance
--------

Plays / Game (i.e., pace) has most variance



Visualization (Dimension Reduction)
--------

PCA:
Appears "non-flat" looking at 3D graph of top 3 PCA components
    - Top 3 components explains 39% variance

Appears spherical to me

t-SNE:
Very much spherical!


Clustering Algorithms
---------------------

Interested in HDBSCAN and OPTICS for the variable density aspects
