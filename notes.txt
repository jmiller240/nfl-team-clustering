Correlations
------------

Strong correlation between neutral down and normal
    - Under center vs shotgun usage rates
    - Pass rates

    - Ignoring neutral downs


Under center rate and shotgun pass rate are strong positive correlation
    - Shotgun rate and shotgun pass rate are strong ~negative~ correlation

    - Makes sense; the more you use shotgun, the more you probably run from it
    - Whereas, the more you use under center, the more you probably run from it, meaning the more you pass when using shotgun


Variance
--------

Plays / Game (i.e., pace) has most variance
